# Windows-Reversing
Reverse engineering binaries built from https://github.com/pjsacchet/Windows-Internals

Through both this repository and the aforementioned Windows-Internals repository I aim to not only understand the development process, the in's and out's of our exploit, and its activity on target but additionally I will be able to analyze the steps at which it is identified as malware to better understand the categorization and actions taken against said malicious code. 

## Repository Breakdown

### Binaries
Each identified set of binaries (for both DLL and EXE) that I've found to be 'hit' by Windows Defender while developing. Through an iterative process, I aim to intermittingly copy binaries built from 'Windows-Internals' repository in an attempt to better understand the steps at which software may be deemed 'malicious' in addition to possible mitigations that can be implemented in order to bypass Windows Security.
